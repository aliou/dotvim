This directory contains settings for various vim plugins and vim itself. This is shamelessly stolen from [@skwp](https://github.com/skwp) dotfiles.

## Plugin Settings

Each plugin's overrides/settings should be put in a separate file named `{plugin-name}.vim`.

## Vim Settings

General vim overrides/settings should be put in a separate file named `aldl-{descriptive-name}.vim`.
